# 2m-70cms-Moxon-antenna

This repository has my design for a 2m / 70cms lightweight Moxon antenna. It's based on a number of other designs that I'll attribute further down.

## Goals

1. Suitable for working FM satellites from a HT - no need for massive gain
1. Lightweight - hence 3d printed parts and minimal structure
1. Easy to disassemble and transport - hence the antenna can be broken down and easily packed

## Progress

Initial 3D prints done. Time for a first fit and tune

## Files

1 x Centre Holder.3mf - holds the main spars and will attach to a selfie stick in due course
4 x Corner Holder.3mf - holds the wire taught at the corners, attached my a bamboo skewer to the Centre Holder
2 x Separator.3mf - used to join the wire and keep the gap
1 x Dipole Centre.3mf - acts as the feedpoint to the coax
