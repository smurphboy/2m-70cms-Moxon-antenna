# 2m-70cms-Moxon-antenna

This repository has my design for a 2m / 70cms lightweight Moxon antenna. It's based on a number of other designs that I'll attribute further down.

## Goals

1. Suitable for working FM satellites from a HT - no need for massive gain
1. Lightweight - hence 3d printed parts and minimal structure
1. Easy to disassemble and transport - hence the antenna can be broken down and easily packed

## Progress

Initial 3D prints done. Time for a first fit and tune
